## Install

As the gem name suggests this is a guard extension. Make sure you get [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) first.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-handlebars
  
Add it to your Gemfile if you're using bundler (you should)
  
    gem 'guard-handlebars'
  
Add a basic guard setup:
  
    guard init handlebars
